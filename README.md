# What is the PiPlant?
PiPlant is a Python 3.6.2 script with a sole purpose - allow anyone on Twitter (yes, ANYONE) to vote whether or not they want to water the plant or not on any particular day, then relay that information to the Pi for information processing (or, "do we water today or not").

# How can I interact with it?
Currently interacting with the PiPlant is not existent. The project needs to now become fully functional and running on a Raspberry Pi with a camera before I make the project fully accessible and functional. However, once the project IS complete and functional, you can tweet out to a particular hashtag, using a "positive" or "negative" word to convey whether you want to water the plant or not for that day.

The current list of positive words are: 'yes', 'yep', 'yepp', 'yeppers', 'yup', 'yupp', 'yuuup', 'ye', 'yee', 'yes please', 'hell yes', 'ofc', 'yass'

The current list of negative words are: 'no', 'nope', 'nop', 'not on your nelly', 'no way', 'not a chance', 'hell no', 'no please', 'nu', 'nein'

# When can I download the code myself?
The code is currently incomplete - however you are more than welcome to try getting it to run yourself on your own hardware. I have yet to verify if it runs on a Raspberry Pi yet - it should work but nothing is certain until I verify it works proper. Once the code is functional, it's only a matter of running code to work on either a Raspberry Pi + Camera module for taking photos, or running code to work on any PC you own with your own watering system.

# Why bother with a website if it's not finished yet?
Mostly because this way it's another step gone for when I do finish the project and get it operational. This link is also in the daily tweet as a kind of "Learn more about this plant here". Part of the testing is a couple of week-long test runs to make sure the system is capable of recovering if there's heavy load, and can handle loads of who-knows-how-many-people tweeting it.

# I'm experiencing X problem, please help!
If you know how to submit a bug on GitHub, please do so if it's a problem with the code itself and not a request to add more default positive/negative codewords. If it's a request to add more codewords, you can add your own in the code.
